# Security Fixes Applied

## Critical Issues Fixed:

### Frontend Security (app.js):
✅ **XSS Prevention**: Added input sanitization function to prevent cross-site scripting
✅ **Secure Event Handlers**: Replaced inline onclick with secure event listeners
✅ **HTTPS URLs**: Changed all HTTP URLs to HTTPS for secure connections
✅ **Input Validation**: Added proper vote validation and error handling

### Backend Security (server.js):
✅ **Rate Limiting**: Added express-rate-limit to prevent brute force attacks
✅ **Security Headers**: Added helmet middleware for security headers
✅ **Input Validation**: Added comprehensive input validation using validator
✅ **Input Sanitization**: Added XSS protection for all user inputs
✅ **File Upload Security**: Restricted file uploads to images only with size limits
✅ **Authentication**: Added proper authentication to sensitive endpoints
✅ **CORS Security**: Updated CORS to only allow HTTPS origins
✅ **Error Handling**: Improved error handling to not expose sensitive information

### Vote System Security (votes.js):
✅ **Duplicate Vote Prevention**: Enhanced vote validation to prevent multiple votes
✅ **Input Sanitization**: Added sanitization for all vote-related inputs
✅ **Secure Vote Storage**: Simplified vote model for better security
✅ **Vote Validation**: Added proper validation for candidate names and positions

### Database Security (vote.js model):
✅ **Simplified Schema**: Removed complex references that could be exploited
✅ **Unique Constraints**: Ensured one vote per user per position
✅ **Input Validation**: Added trim and required validations

## Additional Security Measures:

### Environment Configuration:
✅ **Environment Variables**: Created .env.example with secure defaults
✅ **JWT Security**: Configured secure JWT settings
✅ **Database Security**: Secure MongoDB connection configuration

### Package Security:
✅ **Security Dependencies**: Added helmet, express-rate-limit, validator, xss
✅ **Scoped Package**: Updated package.json with scoped name for security

## Installation Instructions:

1. **Install Security Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd campus-election-backend
   npm install
   ```

2. **Configure Environment**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your secure values
   ```

3. **Generate Secure JWT Secret**:
   ```bash
   node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(64).toString('hex'))"
   ```

4. **Use HTTPS in Production**:
   - Configure SSL certificates
   - Use reverse proxy (nginx/Apache)
   - Enable HTTPS redirects

## Security Checklist for Deployment:

- [ ] Change default JWT secret in .env
- [ ] Configure HTTPS certificates
- [ ] Set up proper database authentication
- [ ] Configure firewall rules
- [ ] Enable logging and monitoring
- [ ] Regular security updates
- [ ] Backup and recovery procedures
- [ ] Security testing and audits

The system is now significantly more secure and ready for deployment with proper HTTPS configuration and environment setup.
